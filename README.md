# Google Summer of Code 2024 - OSCSA Project Proposals

## Project 1: Development of the Open Innovation Platform

#### Overview:
The Open Innovation Platform stands as a comprehensive online learning environment designed to foster open science within the Arabic-speaking community. It encompasses a wide range of educational content, including video lectures, multiple-choice questions, and written resources, tailored to meet the needs of researchers, academics, and educational bodies across Arabic-speaking territories. This initiative, in collaboration with entities such as the sFDA and King Faisal University, utilises resources from esteemed projects like Carpentries and Turing Way to provide accessible, top-tier education.

#### Technical Infrastructure:
Constructed with React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB, the platform embodies the principles of open-source development. It advocates for open licensing through the CC-BY license on GitHub, encouraging content distribution, modification, and wider accessibility.

#### Internship Focus:
The appointed intern will undertake a 4-month project to create an intuitive administrative interface for the platform. This interface will streamline the content management process, enabling contributors, irrespective of their technical prowess, to effortlessly upload and collaborate on educational content.

#### Required Expertise:
Applicants should have a robust background in web development, with a strong emphasis on user experience design principles.

## Project 2: Localisation of the Turing Way into Multiple Languages

#### Overview:
The Turing Way, an influential guide from The Alan Turing Institute, aspires to transform the culture of data science. Spanning a broad spectrum of subjects from reproducibility to ethics, it has attracted extensive contributions from around the globe. The project now aims to extend its impact by localising its content into various languages, including Arabic.

#### Community and Infrastructure:
A specialised working group underpins this localisation effort, promoting inclusivity and sustained engagement. The group prioritises governance and technical integration, fostering a cooperative atmosphere for international contributors.

#### Internship Role:
The intern will concentrate on improving the digital infrastructure to facilitate efficient localisation workflows. This includes enhancing documentation and creating tools to facilitate the acknowledgment of contributions beyond GitHub commits. This endeavour will link closely with efforts to establish a robust governance strategy and bolster community engagement within the localisation process. It aims to streamline the deployment of translations, ensuring a cohesive workflow across different languages.
